## The Inebriator
The Inebriator is a machine for automatic bartending.The console runs on a .NETMF Fez Panda II, storing all information of cocktail. When the console starts to work, a glass slides on the rails automatically and accurately. There are several bottles of cocktail on the top of the machine. The glass moves to the bottom of the specific bottles, and the cocktail goes down to the glass. And then, a glass of cocktail is finished.

## Photocells
Photocell is a sensor which can detect lights. Photocell is a kind of resistor changed by the light shining onto the squiggly face. But it is inaccurate, which means it should not be used to determine the precise light level.
## Force Sensitive Resistor(FSR)
FSR can detect physical pressure, squeezing and weight. It is basically a kind of resistor that the resistive value is changed by how much it is pressed. But it is rarely accurate. So it is not a good choice to use it to detect exact pressure. 
## Tilt Sensor
Tilt sensor allow you to detect orientation or inclination. It is made by a cavity and a conductive free mass inside, which is slideable. The resistive value is determined by the position of the mass, and it is why the tilt sensor can detect the orientation.

# Week 3
## Concept
The touch board is a platform to tap different objects. The speaker will play a sound of one object, when the object is tapped.
## Programm
The force sensor (conductive paint) detects the change of force, and the speaker works.
