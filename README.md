The Inebriator is a machine for automatic bartending.The console runs on a .NETMF Fez Panda II, storing all information of cocktail. When the console starts to work, a glass slides on the rails automatically and accurately. There are several bottles of cocktail on the top of the machine. The glass moves to the bottom of the specific bottles, and the cocktail goes down to the glass. And then, a glass of cocktail is finished.
